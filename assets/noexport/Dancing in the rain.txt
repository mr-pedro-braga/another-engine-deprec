# Dancing in the rain

On a rainy day...
The soft light of the sky may make you think...
You're looking trough the window at yourself...

But who's this one you're looking at?
So familiar and yet so mysterious...

On a rainy day...
It's easy to forget the sun even exists.
The world seems all so dull, devoid of colour...

And a world that's so colourless...
...on secound thought may sound way too familiar...

I know, it's tough.
I know it isn't fair.
There's nothing I can say to make it easy!

You WILL feel bad.
And hopeless more than once.
And sometimes you will wish that you were gone.

[Choir SOLO]

I'll tell you a secret!
A powerful spell...
I'll show you the path
to the true freedom!

With the storm comes thunder
roaring trough the sky.
Face head on your monster;
He's your closest friend.

Come on, let's jump in the puddles!
Come on, let's be slightly lighter...
You can be stronger when you're hurt!
You can be stronger with this truth:

There's no better way
to wash out all your pain
than getting out and
dancing in the rain.

I know it is tough;
there's nothing we can do
but trying to accept
that we're alive!

Get yourself and ask
your own hand for a dance!
Try to practice your moves,
try to practice your stance.

Living with yourself,
a style of free verse.
And hopefully you will
find your own rhyme~.
